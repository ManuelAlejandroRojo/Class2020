This is the repository for the class examples and Rmarkdown, homework and other files for regression class 2020, almost all the examples that I will deposit here are R code and Rmarkdown vertions of the examples at Rcode. As mention in the class the general course is based (‘loosely based’) on the material of the text book:Harrel "Regression Modeling Strategies, with applications to linear models, logistic and ordinal regression and survival Analysis", ISBN 978-3-319+33039-6, Springer, 2015. And also the other book of Vittinghoff, Glidden, Shiboski, and McCulloch, “Regression methods in biostatistics: linear, logistic, survival, and repeated measures models”, ISBN 0-387-20275-7, Springer 2005. https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461413523 (From a network connection inside the UNAM, you can download the book’s pdf for free).  The CAR Book from Fox is very much used as examples.  For the coursework is mandatory that you use R and highly recommended that you use RStudio. The Rmarkdown examples are formatted for you to run the R code examples, you can copy the R code to the R console to run direcly, you can play with the code and experiment with different parameters and ideas, and then to generate your own R code. I will try to keep the repository formatted, nevertheless I cannot be sure if I will. October 2020
