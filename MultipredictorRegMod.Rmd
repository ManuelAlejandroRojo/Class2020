# Exercise and Glucose

Glucose levels above 125 mg/dL are diagnostic of diabetes, while levels in the range
from 100 to 125 mg/dL signal increased risk of progressing to this serious and
increasingly widespread condition. So it is of interest to determine whether exercise,
a modifiable lifestyle factor, would help people reduce their glucose levels and thus
avoid diabetes.
