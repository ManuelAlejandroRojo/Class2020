# Exercise and Glucose

Glucose levels above 125 mg/dL are diagnostic of diabetes, while levels in the range from 100 to 125 mg/dL signal increased risk of progressing to this serious and increasingly widespread condition. So it is of interest to determine whether exercise, a modifiable lifestyle factor, would help people reduce their glucose levels and thus avoid diabetes.
The R code shows a simple linear model using a measure of exercise to predict baseline glucose levels among 2,032 participants without diabetes, and boxplot of the data, in the HERS.
